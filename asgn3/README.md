## Gen AI Acknowledgment

As with assignment 0, 1 & 2, the HTML was written w/ the help of gen AI, as I
reused the HTML between each assignment.

With this assignment, I moved over to Typescript, and to speed up this process,
I asked Claude Sonnet 4.5 to write Typescript bindings for the library classes
we've been using until now. As part of easing development, I moved the animation
and transform classes out of `asgn2` and moved them into lib. I asked Claude to
write typescript bindings for these to ease usage.
