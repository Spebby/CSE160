# Assignment 3

This is the "Blocky World" project! It takes a lot of what we've built before
and goes further. The bulk of time spent on this was spent refactoring
assignment 2's work to be reusable. This took quite a bit of work as priorities
changed, as I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do until quite late.

## Gen AI Acknowledgment

As with assignment 0, 1 & 2, the HTML was written w/ the help of gen AI, as I
reused the HTML between each assignment.

With this assignment, I moved over to Typescript, and to speed up this process,
I asked Claude Sonnet 4.5 to write Typescript bindings for the library classes
we've been using until now. As part of easing development, I moved the animation
and transform classes out of `asgn2` and moved them into lib. I asked Claude to
write typescript bindings for these to ease usage. I also asked it with help in
writing the "GLStateOverride" functionality for the Shape class, though I
described the interface.

`generatePoints` was generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5, as I wanted a sampling
method similar to Poisson Disk, but didn't feel it was worth implementing
myself.
