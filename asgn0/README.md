## Gen AI Acknowledgment

Generative AI was used in generating the HTML for the website. I provided a
basic, unstyled layout based on what the assignment page showed. I asked an LLM
(GPT 4) to "pretty it up" with default Bootstrap 5 classes, and some manual
direction. There were some manual changes made by me after (dark colouring, log
line, test link, canvas styling)
