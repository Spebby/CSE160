# Assignment 1

A simple paint tool to serve as an introduction to WebGL.

## Sources

This code uses code from Matsuda & Lea's ColoredPoint.js example from the "WebGL
Programming Guide". Found in
[Chapter 2](https://sites.google.com/site/webglbook/home/chapter-2/) section 5.

## Gen AI Acknowledgment

Generative AI was used in generating the HTML for the website. I provided a
screenshot of the example unstyled layout present on the assignment page, and I
asked an LLM (GPT 4) to "pretty it up" with default Bootstrap 5 classes, and
some manual direction. This screenshot included a "clear canvas" button,
"drawing mode" selection, RGB sliders, "Shape Size" & "Circle Segment Count"
sliders. I wired it up manually, and added additional content not in the
original image.
