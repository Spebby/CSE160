# Assignment 1

A simple paint tool to serve as an introduction to WebGL.

## Gen AI Acknowledgment

As I reused the base of Assignment 0, the same notice is required. Generative AI
was used in generating the HTML for the website. I provided a basic, unstyled
layout based on what the assignment page showed. I asked an LLM (GPT 4) to
"pretty it up" with default Bootstrap 5 classes, and some manual direction.
There were some manual changes made by me after (dark colouring, log line, test
link, canvas styling)
