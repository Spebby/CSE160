# Assignment 2

A 3D animation of an animal, powered by WebGL.

I make use of a transform wrapper to simplify the creation of complex meshes,
though this adds slight overhead. Performance is not bad enough to justify it,
but a dirty flag would be a good optimisation, which I briefly considered.

None, so far.
